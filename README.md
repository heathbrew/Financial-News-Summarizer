**Title**: Financial News Summarizer

**1. Problem Statement**:
The Financial News Summarizer aims to address the challenge of efficiently summarizing financial news articles related to specific stock tickers. The goal is to provide users with concise summaries of relevant news articles, along with sentiment analysis, to help them quickly understand the overall sentiment and key points about a particular stock.

**2. Solution**:
The solution involves building a web application that allows users to enter a stock ticker. The application will then search for recent news articles related to the given stock ticker, extract relevant content, generate summaries using the LSA summarization technique, and analyze sentiment using the TextBlob library. The summarized information, sentiment analysis results, and relevant URLs will be displayed to the user.

**3. Tech Stack Used**:
- Python (Flask framework)
- Beautiful Soup (for web scraping)
- TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)
- Sumy (for text summarization using LSA)
- HTML/CSS (for web interface)
